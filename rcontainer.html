    		<h3>Website</h3>
    		<h5>2013 - 2014</h5>
    		<p>I was assigned to design and develop a new website in Wordpress using a bespoke Woocommerce solution to receive inqueries for the clients product catalogue, containing almost 900 products at the time.</p>
    		<p>The website was launched in Norwegian and English.
    		<p>The design and visual identity was provided by <a href="http://nxta2n.no/" target="_blank" class="url">NXT</a>. </p>
    
    		<p>My role was to build the website and implement the design as specified by the digital agency and populate it with content from all of their producers. </p>
    		<p>The site has been maintained by another agency since last summer.</p>
